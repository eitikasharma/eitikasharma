## üìå Projects
Here, you will find a range of projects showcasing my expertise in *data analytics, visualization, and automation* :

- *[Smart Parking Guide: A Solution for Dyslexia-Related Challenges](https://github.com/eitikasharma/ParkingApp)-* Built a mobile application that simplifies on-street parking for users with dyslexia. The app allows users to take photos of parking signs they find difficult to interpret, and provides clear, real-time feedback on whether parking is permitted at that location. The app checks for parking timings, restrictions, and special requirements such as badges or permits, enhancing accessibility and ease of use for individuals with reading difficulties.

  
- *[Customer Segmentation Analysis](https://github.com/eitikasharma/Customer-Segmentation-Analysis)-* Designed and implemented a data-driven customer segmentation model to analyse user buying behaviours. Using clustering techniques, the project segmented customers based on purchasing patterns, demographics, and preferences. The model was used to recommend personalized products to existing users and suggest relevant items to new users based on similar human buying behaviour patterns.

  
- *[NHS Scotland Dynamic Scheduling](https://github.com/eitikasharma/NHS-Scotland-Dynamic-Scheduling)-* This project presents a robust solution to manage the workforce more effectively within National Health Services in Scotland. By leveraging data analytics and predictive modeling, the dynamic scheduling system can help reduce waiting times and improve the overall efficiency of healthcare delivery.<br/>
  
- *[Financial Analytics Categorization](https://github.com/eitikasharma/Financial-Analytics-Categorization-Project)-* Machine learning project to streamline mortgage applications by accurately calculating annual gross income from monthly net income, enhancing fraud detection, and improving financial categorization. Achieved high accuracy and efficiency in income verification.<br/>

- *[Bitcoin Price Prediction](https://github.com/eitikasharma/Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-ML)-* A machine learning project to predict Bitcoin prices. Analyzed multiple factors influencing Bitcoin, including other cryptocurrencies, financial indices, and social trends. <br/>
